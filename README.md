ScleraU-Net2 is developed by the Visual Computing Group (VCG) of Democritus University of Thrace (DUTh) for the participation in the SSBC 2020 competition. It is based on the original U-Net, comprising a reduced number of layers, leading to a lightweight architecture that is tailored towards sclera segmentation. A key improvement in ScleraU-Net2 is the use of Group Normalization (GN) after each convolutional layer. Additionally, the activations of all convolutional layers are replaced with GELUs.
